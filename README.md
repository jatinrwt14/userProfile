<!-- Architecture

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is a design pattern that separates the user interface (View) from the business logic and data (Model) using an intermediary (ViewModel).

The Model represents the data and business rules of the application.

The View is responsible for displaying the UI and forwarding user interactions.

The ViewModel acts as a bridge, handling presentation logic, exposing data in a format the View can use, and managing UI state.

MVVM improves testability, maintainability, and separation of concerns by decoupling UI from the business logic.
